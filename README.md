## Description

Movie Finder is a dynamic movie search and favorites app built with ASP.NET Core and powered by C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to search for movies, add their favorites to a personalized list, and access detailed movie information through a direct link to the official TMDB website. It uses the TMDB API to fetch up-to-date movie data, ensuring users have the latest movie details. The app is supported by a PostgreSQL database to store user favorites and is deployed using Docker on the Render platform for seamless hosting and scaling.


### Features:
Search for Movies: Quickly search movies by title.
Movie Details: Displays Poster images of movies. 
Responsive Design: Fully mobile-responsive design for seamless use on all devices.
External Movie Data: Pulls movie data from a third-party API (e.g., The Movie Database API).
